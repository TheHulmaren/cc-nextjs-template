**REMINDER:** 
[1] Check WHITEBOARD.md for current progress and next steps. 
[2] AVOID VIEWING OR EDITING CODES DIRECTLY - let personas do code analysis & coding. Your contexts are precious.
[3] When calling personas, if the task seems intensive, split big tasks into smaller ones, and call dedicated subagents for each smaller tasks.
[4] Use only port 3003 for dev server. If port is already taken, kill current process and start dev server. 
[5] Always start coding on user's approval on your plan.

- If user asks you to archive current WHITEBOARD.md, check guides in [.claude/utils/whiteboard-compression-strategy.md] before you proceed to compress.
